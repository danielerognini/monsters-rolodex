# monsters-rolodex
This is a react project I made during the react course I'm following

The website is very simple, it holds a bunch of cards which are filled with images and informations taken from different APIs:
- [User informations](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users)
- [Images](https://robohash.org/)

And it also has a search bar on top which allows you to filter the cards as you fill it with letters, debending on if their name contains those letters or not.
